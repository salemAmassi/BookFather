Welcome to Kotobgy!
-------------------

Kotobgy is a modern open-source Bookstore manager with basic CRUD operations
built using Java and JPA.


A lot of the basic features are available, more management features will be made available SOON™. Feel free to open issues!

What makes Kotobgy different from other bookstore management software?

* **On-off components** Broken up view means you can easily fit any service into the main dashboard
and have it feel like it's always been there. A bit of abstraction magic!
* **Cross-Language support** With different customers in mind, Kotobgy offers separate
language files, that can be swapped in or out, to directly affect the entire user interface.
We plan on supporting Arabic and English, other languages may be included in future releases.
* **Do it yourself.** Code simplicity and structure gives you the ability to make Kotobgy
suit your very own needs, with minimal rework. Have a feature in mind? 
Relish the powers of [Open Source](https://github.com/salemAmassi/BookStore_Kotobgy/fork).

Kotobgy may have fulfilled all fundamental objectives, but we're not stopping there. We have many feature ideas
that we're anxious to add and other innovative accessibility options that we're planning to build into Kotobgy. 
So take Kotobgy out for a spin and let us know how we can make it your favorite store manager.
